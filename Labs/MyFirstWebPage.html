		<p>It is not the critic who counts; not the man
		who points out how the strong man stumbles, or
		where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
		The credit belongs to the man who is actually in
		the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat
		and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who
		comes short again and again, because <i style='color: red;'>there is no
		effort without error and shortcoming</i>; but who does
		actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great
		enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself
		in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end
		the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst,
		if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so
		that his place shall never be with those cold and timid
		souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</p>
